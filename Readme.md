## C Backend Framework (CBack)
This repository contains the implementation of a backend development framework for C. 
Supports basic functionalities of a website such as rendering html templates, sending and receiving json and form data, allows use of dynamic urls and query parameters, defining endpoints and developing APIs and also has an inbuilt cookie based Authentication system. All this can be done very easily using functions given in the library.
Detailed information to be up very soon. Inspired from Flask.
